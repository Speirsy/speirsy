      My mum says this building website is a waste of time and no one will visit it because my songs aren't very good. 
      But I don't believe her. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hBAQuQVxEY'>"Hey There Andy Murray"</a> got thousands of views in 2013 which is like a million in today's money, and some people come back and watch it sometimes. And it was in the papers. So it is a good song. 
      She says "The Spiral" got, like, no views (which isn't true) but I've had people message me from the spiral saying they went there because of my video. "Should I Move Out Of My Mum's House" is a song I'm really proud of and it doesn't matter if she thinks it's rubbish. 
      I got paid actual money to write "Sports Personality" and that's called a commision. My mum borrowed the money though and never paid me back. She says "Dear Santa" is ok but only cause she gets a mention in it. I don't think she's even listened to any of the others. 
      But I don't care what she thinks anymore. I'm going to keep doing it anyway.
