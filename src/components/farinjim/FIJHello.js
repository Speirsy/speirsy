        My mum says that building a website is a waste of time and no one will visit it because my songs aren't very good. 
        But I don't accept that. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hBAQuQVxEY'>"Hey There Andy Murray"</a> got thousands of views in 2013 which is like a million in today's money, and some people come back and watch it sometimes. And it was in the papers. So it is a good song. 
        She says <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxcxt_KRpNk'>"The Spiral"</a> got, like, no views (which isn't true) but I've had people message me from the spiral saying they went there because of my video. "Should I Move Out Of My Mum's House" is a song I'm really proud of and it doesn't matter if she thinks it's rubbish. 
        I got paid actual money to write "Sports Personality" and that's called a commision. My mum borrowed the money though and never paid me back. She says "Dear Santa" is ok but only cause she gets a mention in it. I don't think she's even listened to any of the others. 
        But I don't care what she thinks anymore. I'm going to keep doing it anyway.
